                                    The AAA (Arrange-Act-Assert) pattern has become almost a standard across the
                                    industry. It suggests that you should divide your test method into three sections:
                                    arrange, act and assert. Each one of them only responsible for the part in which
                                    they are named after.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    So the arrange section you only have code required to setup that specific test. Here
                                    objects would be created, mocks setup (if you are using one) and potentially
                                    expectations would be set. Then there is the Act, which should be the invocation of
                                    the method being tested. And on Assert you would simply check whether the
                                    expectations were met.

                                            <p class="card-text">
                                                Guidelines
                                                <br>
                                                <br>
                                                1. Start every Action line with result =.
                                                <br>
                                                2. This makes it easier to distinguish test actions and means you can
                                                avoid
                                                the hardest job in programming: naming. When every result is called
                                                result, then you do not need to waste brain power wondering if it should
                                                be item = or response = etc. An added benefit is that you can find test
                                                actions easily with a tool like grep.
                                                <br>
                                                3. Even when there is no result from the action, capture it with result
                                                =
                                                and then assert result is None. In this way, the SUTâ€™s behaviour is
                                                pinned.
                                                <br>
                                                4. If you struggle to write a single line action, then consider
                                                extracting
                                                some of that code into your arrangement.
                                                <br>
                                                5. The action can be wrapped in with ... raises for expected exceptions.
                                                In
                                                this case your action will be two lines surrounded by empty lines.

                                                3. Limit the actions that you make in this block. Ideally, no actions
                                                should happen, but that is not always possible.
                                                <br>
                                                4. Use simple blocks of assertions. If you find that you are repeatedly
                                                writing the same code to extract information from the SUT and perform
                                                assertions on it, then consider extracting an assertion helper.
